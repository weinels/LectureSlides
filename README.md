# Lecture Slides
This repository contains lecture slides I created for various classes I have taught.

## Using these slides
All the slides are written in LaTeX. Each presentation is a self contained PDF file.

To use the slides, you merely need use a PDF viewer capable of displaying fullscreen.

Note: Powerpoint will not work for these slides.

OSX Users: I use the wonderful [Pr√©sentation](http://iihm.imag.fr/blanch/software/osx-presentation/). It provides slide preview and presentation timers, among other nice features.

## Compiling the slides
All these slides are written in LaTeX. The included packages will need to be in your LaTeX search path.

These slides contain copious amount of inline [Asymptote](http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/). You can use either [latexmk](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexmk/) or the [scripts](https://github.com/weinels/LaTeX/tree/master/scripts) I have written.
