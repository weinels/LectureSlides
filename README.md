# Lecture Slides
This repository contains lecture slides I created for various classes I teach.

## Using these slides
Each presentation is a self contained PDF file. To use the slides, you will need a PDF viewer capable of displaying fullscreen. I will also upload the PDF to canvas so my students have access to the slides.

**Note: Powerpoint will not work on these slides.**

### Mac Users 
I recommend the wonderful [Pr√©sentation](http://iihm.imag.fr/blanch/software/osx-presentation/). It provides slide preview and presentation timers, among other nice features. It's what I use when giving these lectures.

## Compiling the slides
All these slides are written using [Beamer](https://bitbucket.org/rivanvx/beamer/wiki/Home) and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).

The files in the packages directory will also need to be in your LaTeX search path.

These slides contain copious amount of inline [Asymptote](http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/). You can use either [latexmk](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexmk/) or the [scripts](https://github.com/weinels/LaTeX/tree/master/scripts) I have written.
